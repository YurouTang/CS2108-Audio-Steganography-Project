# CS2108-Audio-Steganography-Project

## Objective
To embed a message in a given music file and be able to decode the message from the encoded music file.

## Instruction
* Edelweiss.mp3, is a file that contains the song “Edelweiss” from the movie “The Sound of Music”.
* Read Edelweiss.mp3, keep the first 36 seconds of the music, and write this truncated music file to an mp4 file called edelweiss_36seconds.mp4.
* Devise a method to embed alphanumeric messages into the music stored in edelweiss_36seconds.mp4. Implement and run in Matlab, then save the message-encoded music into edelweiss_with_message.mp4.
* Devise a method to decode the message from the file edelweiss_with_message.mp4. You are supposed to implement your decoding in Matlab.
